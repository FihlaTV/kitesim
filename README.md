## What?
This is a real time dynamic model of a tethered kite which can be useful for visualisation, parameter estimation, flight controller development and so forth for airborne wind turbines. 

## install & use

1. install node js and npm
2. run `npm install`
3. run `gulp`
4. open `docs/index.html`

### livereload
To increase development speed a gulp will be tracking any file changes and process/copy files when needed. If you have the livereload plugin for chrome (and the livereload setting: local files activated) then the browser will automatically reload the page on file changes. 

## editor
We recommend using Visual Studio Code which is typescript aware.
